## How to Use This Course

Each lesson has its own directory in `/exercises` containing:
- `index.html` - The exercise file with starter code
- `README.md` - Lesson notes, objectives, and instructions (where applicable)
- `solution.html` - Reference solution (complete after attempting)

Work through lessons sequentially, as concepts build upon each other.

## Getting Started

Open the exercise files in your browser and code editor. Use browser DevTools to experiment and debug. Happy learning!
